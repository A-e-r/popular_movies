# Project 1: Popular Movies
===========================

Project 1 for the [Udacity Android Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801)

The app displays information and advertising material for popular and highly rated movies. It relies on [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for its data.

To make requests to the API, the app requires a [key](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup?language=en) which should be added as a string resource, named `movie_api_key`.

# Requirements
The project had the following requirements:

> * Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
> * Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
> ** The sort order can be by most popular, or by highest-rated
> * Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
> ** original title
> ** movie poster image thumbnail
> ** A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
> ** user rating (called vote_average in the api)
> ** release date
